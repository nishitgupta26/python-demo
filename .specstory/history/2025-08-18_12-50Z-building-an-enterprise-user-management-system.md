# Building an enterprise user management system (2025-08-18 12:50Z)

_**User**_

i want to create a system for our organizations EUM(Enterprise user management) (opened in browser u can refer)software such that i will give some documents to the model it will store them will use Agentic Rag langraph redis cache mcp servers 

we have our production ready EUM system and i want to create that thing and would call its apis to do tasks

in our application we have may flows like user can create org, group, onboard any user, rename details , etc etc 

so if a user asks to rename a firstname then according to his permissions...we will allow and ask for required details klike username for that ...new firstname and followup questions based on document we will give to complete the process

basically we want to engage he user till is work is done 

i am new in tghis domain ...start with a basic python code....add then make advancements step by step so that i can understand what we are doing and its basics and deep understanding

explain your changes in a way such that i can understand and also start from basics

for now lets satrt with a project that takes pdfs as input and replies based on that and uses RAb..we willl gradually enhance it

after every change ...explain it in brielf and ask me before proceeding


first setup a very basic environment with essential files and then make advancemets in it

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create an Enterprise User Management (EUM) system with Agentic RAG using LangGraph, Redis cache, and MCP servers. Let's start with the basics and build it step by step so you can understand each component.

Let me first create a todo list to track our progress, then set up the basic project structure.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Set up basic project structure with essential files (requirements.txt, main.py, config)
- [ ] Implement basic PDF ingestion and RAG functionality
- [ ] Add Redis caching for embeddings and responses
- [ ] Implement LangGraph for conversation flow management
- [ ] Add MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for external API integration
- [ ] Integrate with production EUM system APIs

---

Now, let me create the basic project structure with essential files:

Let me create the environment file with a different name:

## Todo List

- [x] Set up basic project structure with essential files (requirements.txt, main.py, config)
- [ ] Implement basic PDF ingestion and RAG functionality
- [ ] Add Redis caching for embeddings and responses
- [ ] Implement LangGraph for conversation flow management
- [ ] Add MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for external API integration
- [ ] Integrate with production EUM system APIs

---

Perfect! I've set up the basic project structure for your EUM RAG system. Let me explain what we've created and why each component is important:

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Just Built

### 1. **Project Structure**
- `requirements.txt` - Contains all the Python libraries we'll need
- `config.py` - Manages all configuration settings (API keys, database settings, etc.)
- `main.py` - The main application that ties everything together
- `config.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `README.md` - Documentation explaining the project

### 2. **Key Components Explained**

**Configuration Management (`config.py`)**:
- Handles all settings like API keys, database connections
- Uses environment variables for security (keeps secrets out of code)
- Validates that required settings are present

**Main Application (`main.py`)**:
- Contains the `EUMRagSystem` class - our main system
- Has placeholder methods for document ingestion and querying
- Includes logging for debugging and monitoring
- Currently returns placeholder responses (we'll implement real functionality next)

**Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)**:
- **LangChain**: For building RAG applications
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database to store document embeddings
- **Redis**: For caching to improve performance
- **LangGraph**: For managing conversation workflows
- **PyPDF2**: For reading PDF files
- **FastAPI**: For building APIs (future use)

### 3. **How RAG Works (Basic Concept)**
RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation
1. **Ingestion**: Upload PDFs â†’ Extract text â†’ Create embeddings â†’ Store in vector database
2. **Query**: User asks question â†’ Find similar content â†’ Use that content to generate answer

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Now that we have the foundation, we can start implementing the actual RAG functionality. The next step would be to implement PDF processing and basic question-answering.

**Before we proceed, please:**
1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key
3. Test the basic setup by running: `python main.py`

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the PDF ingestion and basic RAG functionality next? This will include:
- Reading PDF files
- Breaking text into chunks
- Creating embeddings
- Storing in vector database
- Basic question answering

Let me know if you have any questions about what we've built so far, or if you'd like me to continue with the next step!

run this application by setting up virual env and then procedd with further steps...no need to ask me for verification...u can comoplete all the further steps to create application

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll set up the virtual environment and run the application, then proceed with implementing the full RAG functionality. Let me start by creating the virtual environment and installing dependencies.
