# Create PDF embeddings for vector database (2025-08-18 15:52Z)

_**User**_

make this project such that ....i give any no. of pdfs in a folder ...it parses them and create embeddings from that and stors in a vector db and then when i query something it responds from that pdf only

no need to add complexity.....simple use any toenizer and all and do this...

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a simple RAG system that processes PDFs from a folder, creates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and responds to queries. Let me first examine the current project structure to understand what's already implemented.

- # EUM RAG System
+ # Simple PDF RAG System
  
- An Enterprise User Management (EUM) system with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities using LangGraph, Redis cache, and MCP servers.
+ A straightforward Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes PDFs from a folder and answers questions based on their content.
  
  ## Overview
  
- This system allows users to:
- - Upload and process PDF documents containing EUM procedures
- - Ask questions about user management processes
- - Get contextual answers based on the uploaded documentation
- - Future: Integrate with production EUM APIs to perform actual tasks
- 
- ## Project Structure
- 
- ```
- python-demo/
- ├── main.py                 # Main application entry point
- ├── config.py              # Configuration management
- ├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
- ├── config.env.example     # Environment variables template
- └── README.md              # This file
- ```
- 
- ## Setup Instructions
- 
- ### 1. Install Dependencies
+ This system allows you to:
+ - **Drop PDFs in a folder** - Just add any number of PDF files to the `pdfs` folder
+ - **Automatic processing** - The system extracts text, creates embeddings, and stores them in a vector database
+ - **Ask questions** - Query the system and get answers based only on your PDF content
+ - **Simple setup** - Minimal dependencies and configuration required
+ 
+ ## Quick Start
+ 
+ ### 1. Setup
  
  ```bash
+ # Install dependencies
+ python setup_simple.py
+ 
+ # Or manually:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- ### 2. Configure Environment
- 
- 1. Copy `config.env.example` to `.env`
- 2. Fill in your OpenAI API key and other configuration values
- 
- ### 3. Run the Application
+ ### 2. Configure API Key
+ 
+ ```bash
+ # Set your OpenAI API key
+ export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. Add PDFs
  
  ```bash
- python main.py
- ```
- 
- ## Current Features
- 
- - ✅ Basic project structure
- - ✅ Configuration management
- - ✅ Logging setup
- - ⏳ PDF document ingestion (coming next)
- - ⏳ RAG functionality (coming next)
- - ⏳ Redis caching (coming next)
- - ⏳ LangGraph workflows (coming next)
- - ⏳ MCP server integration (coming next)
- - ⏳ EUM API integration (coming next)
- 
- ## Next Steps
- 
- We'll implement features incrementally:
- 1. PDF processing and text extraction
- 2. Vector embeddings and storage
- 3. Basic RAG query functionality
- 4. Redis caching for performance
- 5. LangGraph for conversation flows
- 6. MCP servers for external integrations
- 7. Production EUM API integration
- 
- ## Architecture (Planned)
- 
- ```
- User Query → LangGraph Workflow → RAG System → Vector Store
-                 ↓                      ↓
-            MCP Servers ←→ Redis Cache ←→ EUM APIs
- ```
+ # Create pdfs folder and add your PDF files
+ mkdir pdfs
+ # Copy your PDF files to the pdfs/ folder
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4. Run
+ 
+ ```bash
+ # Simple usage
+ python simple_rag.py
+ 
+ # Or interactive example
+ python example_usage.py
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Project Structure
+ 
+ ```
+ python-demo/
+ ├── simple_rag.py          # Main SimplePDFRAG class
+ ├── example_usage.py       # Interactive example
+ ├── setup_simple.py        # Setup script
+ ├── requirements.txt       # Minimal dependencies
+ ├── pdfs/                  # Put your PDF files here
+ ├── chroma_db/            # Vector database (auto-created)
+ └── README.md             # This file
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Usage
+ 
+ ### Basic Usage
+ 
+ ```python
+ from simple_rag import SimplePDFRAG
+ 
+ # Initialize
+ rag = SimplePDFRAG(openai_api_key="your-key")
+ 
+ # Process all PDFs in the folder
+ rag.process_pdf_folder()
+ 
+ # Ask questions
+ answer = rag.query("What is this document about?")
+ print(answer)
+ 
+ # Ask more specific questions
+ answer = rag.query("What are the main requirements?")
+ print(answer)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Features
+ 
+ - ✅ **PDF Text Extraction** - Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from PDFs
+ - ✅ **Text Chunking** - Intelligently splits documents into manageable chunks
+ - ✅ **Vector Embeddings** - Uses OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
+ - ✅ **Vector Storage** - ChromaDB for persistent storage
+ - ✅ **Similarity Search** - Finds most relevant chunks for each query
+ - ✅ **LLM Integration** - GPT-3.5-turbo for generating answers
+ - ✅ **Simple Interface** - Easy-to-use Python class
+ - ✅ **Folder Processing** - Processes all PDFs in a folder automatically
+ - ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of processing failures
+ 
+ ### Configuration
+ 
+ The system uses minimal configuration:
+ 
+ - **PDF Folder**: `./pdfs` (customizable)
+ - **Database Path**: `./chroma_db` (customizable)
+ - **Chunk Size**: 1000 characters
+ - **Chunk Overlap**: 200 characters
+ - **Embedding Model**: text-embedding-3-small
+ - **LLM Model**: gpt-3.5-turbo
+ 
+ ## How It Works
+ 
+ 1. **PDF Processing**: Extracts text from all PDFs in the specified folder
+ 2. **Text Chunking**: Splits text into overlapping chunks for better retrieval
+ 3. **Embedding Creation**: Generates vector embeddings for each chunk
+ 4. **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in ChromaDB for fast similarity search
+ 5. **Query Processing**: When you ask a question:
+    - Finds most similar document chunks
+    - Provides context to GPT-3.5-turbo
+    - Returns an answer based only on your PDF content
+ 
+ ## Requirements
+ 
+ - Python 3.8+
+ - OpenAI API key
+ - PDF files to process
+ 
+ ## Dependencies
+ 
+ - `langchain` - For text processing and LLM integration
+ - `langchain-openai` - OpenAI integration
+ - `langchain-chroma` - ChromaDB integration
+ - `pypdf2` - PDF text extraction
+ - `chromadb` - Vector database
+ - `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
+ - `openai` - OpenAI API client
```

Perfect! I've successfully transformed your project into a simple PDF RAG system. Here's what I've created:

## 🎉 **Your Simple PDF RAG System is Ready!**

### **What I've Built:**

1. **`simple_rag.py`** - The main SimplePDFRAG class that:
   - Processes all PDFs in a folder automatically
   - Creates embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
   - Stores them in ChromaDB vector database
   - Answers queries based only on your PDF content

2. **`example_usage.py`** - Interactive example showing how to use the system

3. **`setup_simple.py`** - Automated setup script

4. **`test_simple_rag.py`** - Test script to verify everything works

5. **Updated `requirements.txt`** - Minimal dependencies only

6. **Updated `README.md`** - Clear instructions for the simplified system

### **How to Use:**

1. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python setup_simple.py
   # or manually: pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your PDFs:**
   ```bash
   # Just copy any PDF files to the pdfs/ folder
   cp your-documents.pdf pdfs/
   ```

4. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   # Simple usage
   python simple_rag.py
   
   # Interactive example
   python example_usage.py
   
   # Test without PDFs
   python test_simple_rag.py
   ```

### **Key Features:**

✅ **Super Simple** - Just drop PDFs in a folder and query them  
✅ **No Complexity** - Uses basic tokenization and chunking  
✅ **Automatic Processing** - Handles any number of PDFs  
✅ **Vector Storage** - ChromaDB for fast similarity search  
✅ **Smart Responses** - Answers based only on your PDF content  
✅ **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles processing failures  

### **Basic Usage in Code:**

```python
from simple_rag import SimplePDFRAG

# Initialize (with your OpenAI API key)
rag = SimplePDFRAG(openai_api_key="your-key")

# Process all PDFs in the folder
rag.process_pdf_folder()

# Ask questions
answer = rag.query("What is this document about?")
print(answer)
```

The system is now exactly what you requested - simple, straightforward, and focused on processing PDFs from a folder and answering questions based on their content. No unnecessary complexity, just the core RAG functionality you need!
